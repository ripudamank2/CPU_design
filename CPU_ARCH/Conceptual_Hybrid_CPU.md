# Conceptual Hybrid CPU Architecture

This document outlines the design of a conceptual CPU architecture that draws inspiration from various existing architectures, combining features to create a versatile and powerful design.

## Word Size and Registers

- **Word Size:** Choose a flexible word size (e.g., 32-bit or 64-bit) to accommodate various data types.
- **Registers:** Implement a set of general-purpose registers inspired by RISC for efficient pipelining and simplified instructions.

## Instruction Set

- Create an instruction set that combines CISC and RISC concepts:
  - Include a mix of simple and complex instructions for versatility.
  - Prioritize a small number of common instructions for efficiency.
  - Provide additional complex instructions for specialized tasks.
  - Support SIMD and vector instructions for data-intensive tasks.

## Memory Hierarchy

- Implement a multi-level memory hierarchy with cache levels, inspired by modern processors, for faster data access.
- Incorporate a Harvard architecture for separate data and instruction caches to improve memory bandwidth.

## Pipeline and Superscalar Execution

- Design a pipeline with multiple stages, allowing instructions to progress through different phases in parallel.
- Integrate superscalar execution capabilities to exploit instruction-level parallelism.

## Explicit Parallelism

- Include features for explicitly specifying parallelism in code, similar to VLIW or EPIC architectures.
- Enable software control over instruction scheduling for performance optimization.

## Multi-threading

- Incorporate multi-threading support, allowing the execution of multiple threads in parallel, inspired by multi-threaded architectures.

## Exception Handling and Control Flow

- Implement efficient exception handling and support for various control flow instructions, such as branches, jumps, and conditional instructions.

## Hybrid Architecture

- As a "hybrid" architecture, make it adaptable to different application domains by providing configuration options for instruction mix and memory hierarchy.

## Performance Monitoring and Control

- Include performance monitoring and control registers to measure and optimize CPU performance.
