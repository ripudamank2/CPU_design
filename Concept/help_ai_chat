Project Scope Summary
The Neural Network Accelerator for Edge AI project aims to create a low-power, compact ASIC optimized for performing neural network inference on edge devices. By focusing on efficient support for CNNs, low latency, and memory-optimized dataflow, this ASIC will enable real-time processing for image, audio, and anomaly detection applications typical in edge environments.

The project will exclude training functionalities and external memory dependencies to keep the design compact and power-efficient. Success will be measured by the design’s ability to meet performance and power targets while reliably executing inference tasks for lightweight neural networks.
